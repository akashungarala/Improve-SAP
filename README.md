# Improve-SAP

Improve-SAP is a SAP enhancement project, in which I have worked as a SAP Technical Developer in the offshore team for the client Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E). Our team tried to improve the user experience of their online portal, which is used by the managers to perform actions related to the organization as well as employees. I have developed 3 new functionalities, 2 enhancements independently and assisted the team in testing the project deliverables.
